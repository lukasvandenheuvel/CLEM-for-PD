# Correlative Light and Electron Microscopy for Early-Stage Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Pathology in Human Post-Mortem Brain Tissue

This Github repository contains analysis code used for the alignment and analysis of immunofluorescence images and electron micrographs of post-mortem brain tissue.

# Content
- **Fiji_macros**: contains scripts for analysis in Fiji (used for Fig. 2-10 in the thesis).
- **Quantification**: contains Python scripts for edge detection and intensity analysis (used for thesis Fig. 9).
- **ReadLif**: contains Python scripts for accessing LIF files (generated by Leica software) and stitching the images (used for thesis Fig. 2, 4-7, 9).
- **RidgeDetection**: contains Python scripts for calculating the electron-dense and ridge content in electron micrographs (used for thesis Fig. 3,7,8).
